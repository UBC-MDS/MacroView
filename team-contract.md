# Group 9 Team Contract

### Work/ Quality Expectation

Work to be completed to the best of our ability given the constraints of the program and personal ability. Acknowledging that some weeks are busier than others and we all have different experience levels/ skillsets, we will nonetheless do our best to produce quality work. It should also be noted that our team values diversity and inclusivity.

Members are generally expected to be at least moderately available (i.e. 1-2 hr response time) during normal working hours. Work may continue at different times and members can complete personal tasks whenever they wish but there is no expectation of availability at any non-standard time.

### Meetings

1. Tuesday 2:00 pm; for establishing tasks for the week.
2. Friday TBD; for collaborative tasks, to-do list, update progress.

Minutes will be posted on Slack. Any checklists or to-do lists will be posted on GitHub Issues.

### Communication

All communication will be through Slack and GitHub. GitHub will be used for submission, work review, and weekly distribution of work. Slack will be mainly for quick, ephemeral, and informal communication.

### Reviews and Deadlines

All members will submit a pull request by Friday night at the latest for their parts. All requests will be reviewed by at least 1 of the other members before approval. All reviews will be done by Saturday morning at the latest.

### Breach of Contract

Breaching of the teamwork contract will be resolved by further discussion.

First, verbal warnings will be given to members who violate the contract during the team meeting.

If the issues persist, the team will reach out to the lab instructor or teaching assistants.
