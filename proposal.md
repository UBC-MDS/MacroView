# Description of Data

The dataset used in this dashboard comes from the Nutrient Value of Some Common Foods published by Health Canada. This [booklet](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data/nutrient-value-some-common-foods-2008.html) contains the nutrient values of 1100 commonly consumed foods in Canada from 19 categories. Each category is contained in a separate .csv file, which can be accessed [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a289fd54-060c-4a96-9fcf-b1c6e706426f). A combined .csv file of all the food items was used to create this dashboard.

The dataset includes 22 columns for each categorized food group. 19 of those columns lists important nutrient values of each food item. For the purposes of this dashboard, which explicitly focuses on macro nutrients, the columns `Food Name`, `Weight (g)`, `Energy (kcal)`,  `Protein (g)`, `Carbohydrate (g)`, and `Total Fat (g)` will be used to visualize nutrient intake and targets.

The column `Food Name` will be used to identify and search for a particular food item. `Weight (g)` along with `Energy (kcal)`will be used to determine the unit energy per gram of each food item. `Protein (g)`, `Carbohydrate (g)`, and `Total Fat (g)` will be used to visualize the macro make-up of each food item.
